Dalinar didnâ€™t look back. 
He walked up to Kaladin and the other members of Bridge Four.
Go, Dalinar said to them, voice kindly. 
Gather your things and the men you left behind. 
I will send troops with you to act as guards. 
Leave the bridges and come swiftly to my camp. You will be safe there. 
You have my word of honor on it.
He began to walk away.
Kaladin shook off his numbness.
